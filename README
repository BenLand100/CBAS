CBAS was created by BenLand100 a very long time ago. It is currently hosted
on github at https://github.com/BenLand100/CBAS and is mostly unused, as it 
was never properly distributed or pushed in the community it was designed 
for.

CBAS is supposed to be a simple IDE with a focus on developing programs that
are distributed in source form only. The target area of development relates
to automating tasks on the computer. As such, CBAS comes with a library of 
useful keyboard/mouse control routines as well as a full compliment of color
base searching functionality. The core library is written in C/++ and the GUI
is written in Java. The idea behind this rather confusing setup was to make
the GUI as flexible platform wise as possible while having a very fast core.
In addition, the goal was to executed compiled programs rather than 
interpreting source code, as was standard in the community CBAS was designed
for. Since the GNU toolset is relatively universal, as is a Java runtime,
those two languages were chosen. In addition, the more specific target for
CBAS was automation of the game Runescape, so using Java would not have been
any overhead at all. It's quite a nice system, if I do say so myself. It's 
worth a look if you're interested in any of the mentioned topics, or using
JNI in both directions. 

To Build CBAS simply run the Makefile in the root directory. Currently CBAS
only runs on Windows and requires the C and C++ compilers distributed with 
MinGW.
